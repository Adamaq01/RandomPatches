# RandomPatches

A bunch of miscellaneous patches for Minecraft.

RandomPatches increases the hardcoded read and login timeouts so slower computers can connect to
servers.

It also adds an option to force returning to the title screen after disconnecting rather than the
Multiplayer/Realms menu.

The configuration can be reloaded with /rpreload or /rpreloadclient.

RandomPatches only contains features that require ASM transformers. Tweaks that don't require ASM
transformers go in [RandomTweaks](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/randomtweaks).
