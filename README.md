# RandomPatches
A bunch of miscellaneous patches for Minecraft.

Currently, it just increases the hardcoded read and login timeouts so slower computers can connect to servers.

RandomPatches only contains features that require ASM transformers. Tweaks that don't require ASM transformers go in [RandomTweaks](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/randomtweaks).
