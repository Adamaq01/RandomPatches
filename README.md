# RandomPatches
A bunch of random patches for Minecraft.

Currently, it just increases the hardcoded read and login timeouts so slower computers can connect to servers.

RandomPatches only contains tweaks that require ASM transformers. Other tweaks go in [RandomTweaks](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/randomtweaks).
